# EffiTrack User Guide

## Introduction

EffiTrack is a **desktop app for managing employees, tracking the efficiency of employees, 
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, EffiTrack can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

EffiTrack simplifies the task of measuring and monitoring employee efficiency for
HR departments. </br> Instead of using time-consuming and error-prone methods like manual documentation or
outdated systems, EffiTrack offers a centralized platform for easy and accurate monitoring of employee performance.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous EffiTrack home folder. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
