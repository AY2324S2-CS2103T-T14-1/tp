### Project: EffiTrack

EffiTrack is a **desktop app for managing employees, tracking the efficiency of employees,
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, EffiTrack can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

EffiTrack simplifies the task of measuring and monitoring employee efficiency for
HR departments. </br> Instead of using time-consuming and error-prone methods like manual documentation or
outdated systems, EffiTrack offers a centralized platform for easy and accurate monitoring of employee performance.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to perform flexible searches for employee's name.
    * What it does: Allows user to find names with partial keyword instead of having to key in exact name.
    * Justification: This feature does not assume the user has a perfect memory to recall the exact name and helps them find the person of interest with greater ease.

* **New Feature**: Added a filter command to search for tags and departments
    * What it does: Allows user to find employees with keywords matching either department or tags or both
    * Justification: This feature can group users under the same department or tags similar to a filter function.

* **New Feature**: Added a comment command for user to add notes to an employee
    * What it does: Allows user comment on a employee about anything
    * Justification: This feature can help user take notes about an employee so that they can be revisited back in the future.
* * 
* **New Feature**: Added a edit deadline command for user to change task deadline
    * What it does: Allows user to edit an existing deadline to match with a task's everchanging timeline
    * Justification: Task deadline might be subjected to promptness or delay therefore this feature allows the deadline to be set flexibly according to situations

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Updated the GUI fields to include comments

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Added documentation for the features `filter`, `edit_deadline`, and `comment` 
        * Did cosmetic tweaks to existing documentation of features
    * Developer Guide:
        * Added user stories
